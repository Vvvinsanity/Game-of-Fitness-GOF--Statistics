##This study focuses on the Individual CF Game atheletes in the standard age group of 18-34 (not Teens or Masters atheletes) worldwide.
According to the 2019 CrossFit Games Rulebook, "the top 20 individual males and 20 females worldwide in the Open, and the top individual athletes in each recognized country will qualify (1.01). Additionally the winning male/female athlete from each of the 15 Sanctioned events for 2019, will receive an invite to compete at the CrossFit Games (3.01). Up to 4 individual athletes may receive at-large bids to the Games at the discretion of CrossFit Inc. (4.06)." Although the national champions in each country still ensures that exclusive qualifying opportunities for the Game could be allocated among the globe, historically, the overwhelming number of Game atheletes were from America. There was few Asian atheletes actually topped in the 40 qualified men and women via the world wide open events listing or in the sanctional events. Did this mean the significant difference in fitness performance among top American CF atheletes and Asian CF atheletes?
